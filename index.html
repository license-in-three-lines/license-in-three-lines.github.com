    <h3>The short version</h3>
    <p>
      Ever wished for a sweet ‘little’ permissive license? Then this is for you.
    </p>

    <h3>The less short version</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>LITL</em> is born out of the need to have a ‘as simple as possible’ license for when you
      just want to release your work to be used in any type of other work. Without the need
      for too much ‘lawspeak’, which could lead to reluctance to read the whole license, or lack
      of understanding thereof. But still making sure you maintain copyright and are not liable
      to provide warranty of any kind.
    </p>
